<p>PR.A.T. <strong>(Primer Checker Results Analysis Tool)</strong> for <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong> is a tool to help you
analyse the <strong><a href="https://www.gisaid.org"  tartget="_blank">GISAID’s</a> Primer Checker</strong> results about <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>.</p>
<p>It uses as input a <strong>Primer Checker results file</strong> containing
mutations for forward/reverse primer and probe. One must also input the total
number of SARS-CoV-2 variants Primer Checker used.</p>
<p>The results is a series of tables and graphs that can be used in publications
presneting the information from the Primer Checker about SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<!--<hr/>
<p>The genetic variability of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the unprecedented amount of sequence data available, necessitate tools for the rapid in silico evaluation of oligonucleotides for application in molecular detection and virus typing.</p>
<p>Primer Checker at the GISAID site is a useful tool in the design of primers targeting SARS-CοV-2. PRAT is a web application build to facilitate further analysis of the Primer Checker tool results for SARS-CoV-2. </p>
<p>It enables a detailed investigation of the specific mismatches present among oligonucleotides (primers and probes) and all the available SARS-CoV-2 variants in GISAID.</p>
<p>A researcher may filter the original Primer Checker results based on country and date range of the variants. PRAT produces descriptive statistics about the mutations, based on the filtering parameters. It also produces barcharts to assess the site, type and frequency of nucleotide substitutions found on primer and probe hybridization regions. Thus, facilitating the design and evaluation of the primer. The barcharts can be customized by the user and be downloaded in various formats. They are of high quality, suitable for publication.</p>
<p>The web application has a simple and user-friendly interface and is based on R and Shiny.</p>
